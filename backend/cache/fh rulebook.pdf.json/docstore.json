They represent the dynamic actions you can perform during a scenario. For now, the most important part of these cards is their level, which is indicated in the upper left corner. If you are unfamiliar with the character, it is recommended that you only play with the level 1 cards for your first game. There are a number of these equal to your hand size. If you are more experienced, you may consider also using the level X cards, which are typically more complicated and situational. You can only bring into a scenario a number of ability cards equal to your hand size, so adding level X cards to your hand means removing an equal number of level 1 cards from your hand.\n\n# Inside the Boxes\n\n# Small Tuck Box\n\nInside the small tuck box, you will find a plastic miniature, which is used to represent your character in every scenario. (Note: The Geminate has two small tuck boxes because they have two separate forms.)\n\n# Large Tuck Box\n\nInside the large tuck box, you will find several things:\n\n- Character Sheets: This sheet is where you will track all persistent information about your character from scenario to scenario.\n- Write a name for your character in the Name field and mark that you are level 1.\n- Level 1 characters start with 30 gold, so write \u201c30\u201d in the Gold field.\n\n# Resources\n\nThere are multiple sheets in each pad because the same card can be played multiple times over the course of a single campaign. But there can only be one character of each class at a given time, so you only need one sheet for now.\n\n# Character Mat\n\nThis mat stays in front of you during a scenario to help you track important rules and various aspects of your character. On the mat, you will find an illustration of your character, plus their hand size, traits, and maximum hit point value at different levels.\n\n# Character Standee\n\nThis standee is an alternative to your plastic miniature. You can use either the standee or the miniature to represent your character, based on your preference.\n\n# Summon Standees\n\nIf your character has abilities that can summon allies into a scenario, you have summon standees for these allies. These allies do not have miniatures, so you must use the standees to represent them.\n\n# Character Tokens\n\nThese tokens are used to track various abilities belonging to your character.\n\n# Initiative Order Token\n\nThis token is used to mark when your turn will occur within any given round of a scenario.\n\n# Personal Quest\n\nDraw two cards from the personal quest deck. This card represents your character\u2019s reason for coming to Frosthaven. Personally collect five different types of herbs through loot tokens.\n\n# Rewards\n\nOnce you complete this personal quest, you will retire your character and choose a new character, unlocking new campaign elements in the process. Personal quests can be secret or public, as the party decides.\n\n# Character Dial\n\nThis dial is used to track your character\u2019s hit points and experience during a scenario.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3049, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a098844a-8028-4d2e-9057-16890dd55053": {"__data__": {"id_": "a098844a-8028-4d2e-9057-16890dd55053", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1a74ae6d-2ec6-47eb-8157-cb6bb61829ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "a537975652d96425dc22c69993bab6731ec909851eecfcf289037f55ee51a527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Creating a Character\n\nItems: You have 30 gold to spend on items to start with.

The party can only play a scenario if it has been unlocked and if they meet its requirements. This does include scenarios that have been completed previously.\n2. Resolve a road event if necessary (see p. 12).\n3. Set up all map tiles for the scenario as depicted in the map layout for the scenario entry.\n4. Retrieve the materials (ability deck, stat card, standees, and initiative tracker) for all monsters shown in the scenario key. Shuffle the ability decks and insert the stat cards in stat sleeves so that only the relevant stats are shown.\n5. Retrieve all overlay tiles shown in the scenario key.\n6. Set up the first room of the scenario as depicted in the main map for the scenario entry.\n7. Retrieve and shuffle all necessary attack modifier decks (character, monster, and ally decks) and retrieve all additional attack modifier cards (b, c, and * cards).\n8. Read the scenario goals, introduction, and special rules in the scenario entry.\n9. Deal three battle goals to each character. Decide which one to keep for each character and discard the others (see p. 17).\n\n# Additional Setup Steps\n\n- Place the token tray nearby.\n- Build the loot deck as depicted by the loot table in the scenario entry (see p. 16).\n- Decide which items to bring for each character from their pool and apply any negative effects and start-of-scenario effects associated with those items (see p. 35).\n- Decide which ability cards to bring for each character from their pool, selecting a number of cards equal to their hand size, which is shown below the portrait on their character mat. Each character\u2019s selected cards will start in their hand.\n- Set each character\u2019s red hit point dial to their maximum hit point value, which is shown below their current level in the chart at the bottom of their character mat.

The party will resolve a road event at the start of each scenario, with the following exceptions:\n\n- At the start of scenario 0 and scenario 1\n- When replaying a lost scenario without first returning to Frosthaven\n- When moving directly to a new scenario that is linked to the previous scenario (see p. 48)\n- When playing a scenario that takes place within Frosthaven itself\n- When playing any scenario in casual mode (see p. 69)\n\nThere are two decks of road events: summer and winter. Draw a random road event from the deck that corresponds to the current season, as shown by the next unmarked box on the campaign calendar (see p. 54).\n\nThe party will perform the following steps when resolving an event card:\n\n1.

All doors are closed to start. When a character enters a closed door, they flip over the door tile to its open side, revealing the adjacent room (see p. 44). Closed doors do not hinder normal character movement, but they otherwise act as walls. No figure can enter a closed door with forced movement (see p. 32). Once a door is open, it is considered a corridor for all purposes (see below) and is not part of either room adjacent to it. Door illustrations vary by environment type, but all door tiles function identically.\n\n# Closed Door\n\n# Open Door/Corridor\n\nWhen a character enters a closed door, they flip over the door tile to its open side, revealing the adjacent room (see p. 44). Closed doors do not hinder normal character movement, but they otherwise act as walls. No figure can enter a closed door with forced movement (see p. 32). Once a door is open, it is considered a corridor for all purposes (see below) and is not part of either room adjacent to it.\n\n# TRAPS\n\nA trap is sprung when any figure enters its hex, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement ends there). When a trap is sprung, it applies some effect to the figure who sprang it and is then removed from the map. Trap effects are varied and are specified either by the scenario key \u2014 if they are a part of a room\u2019s setup \u2014 or by the ability of the figure who placed the trap. If part of a trap\u2019s effect is listed as \u201cdamage\u201d in the scenario key, the trap will deal damage equal to 2 plus the scenario level (see p. 16).\n\n# OBSTACLES\n\nFigures cannot enter a hex with an obstacle, except when flying or jumping (unless the jump movement would end there). Obstacles do not block line-of-sight (see p. 21). Any section of a map tile surrounded by wall lines is considered to be a separate room.\n\n# WALLS\n\nLike the walls on the border of a map tile, figures cannot cross the wall lines into a wall hex by any means, even when flying or jumping.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nObjectives are tied to the goal of some scenarios and typically need to be destroyed or protected. In either case, the special rules for the scenario will assign a maximum hit point value to each objective, usually based on the scenario level (see p. 16) and the number of characters. Objectives can be targeted by attacks and suffer damage, but are immune to all conditions and forced movement. Objectives are considered to have initiative 99 for the purpose of focusing, unless otherwise stated by the special rules for the scenario, but do not take turns. Any damage an objective suffers is marked by placing damage tokens directly on it. When the total damage suffered by an objective is equal to its maximum hit point value, the objective is destroyed and the objective tile is removed from the map. Objectives are considered figures and the hexes they are in are considered occupied. Objectives are not considered obstacles.\n\n# TREASURES\n\nTreasure can be looted by characters (see p. 32). When a treasure is looted, its effect is applied and the treasure tile is removed from the map. Goal treasure is related to the completion of a scenario, with effects specified in the special rules for the scenario. Numbered treasure is more varied, with effects specified in the Treasure Index (see p. 78).\n\nIf the treasure provides an item, find one copy of that item in the unavailable supply and add it to your pool of items. You may then use it normally for the remainder of the scenario as if you had brought it into the scenario, even if it puts you above the limit for that type of item (see p. 35). If the treasure provides an item blueprint, find all copies of that item in the unavailable supply and add them to the available craftable supply (see p. 58). If the treasure provides a random item blueprint, draw a card from the random item blueprint deck and add it and all other copies of that item to the available craftable supply (see p. 65). If there are no cards left in the random item blueprint deck, gain 1 inspiration instead (see p. 54).\n\nIf the treasure unlocks a random scenario, draw a card from the random scenario deck, read the section specified on the card in the section book, and then remove the card from the game. If there are no cards left in the random scenario deck, gain 1 inspiration instead (see p. 54).\n\nWhen a numbered treasure is looted, check it off in the Treasure Index (see p.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4417, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "595ef325-4498-4bb6-8ec7-7fbbc351df89": {"__data__": {"id_": "595ef325-4498-4bb6-8ec7-7fbbc351df89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40fee709-6922-4387-b020-56a3ba855b8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "45961da89e9d6410b7974051b74a5fa3d3ba1d9c613e07767c8fa17fc74e2219", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db96b331-1b74-4eee-a6e5-74f9fa1ddf22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "1fc35a0c0391cb9d77fd9b0eb3670a07574b92abb6113312bf9f223432bf9a57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "35).

Unlike trap tiles, hazardous terrain tiles are not removed after their effect is applied; instead, they remain on the map indefinitely. Figures do not suffer additional damage when starting a turn in a hazardous terrain tile or exiting a hazardous terrain hex.\n\n# DIFFICULT TERRAIN\n\nA figure requires 2 movement points to enter a difficult terrain hex, except when flying or jumping (even if the jump movement ends there).\n\n# CORRIDORS\n\nA corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the border hexes and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors are considered empty hexes and are not considered to be overlay tiles for the purposes of determining what other tiles or tokens can be placed in the same hex.\n\n# ICY TERRAIN\n\nIf any figure enters an icy terrain hex, except when teleporting, flying, or jumping (including when the jump movement ends there), that figure is forced to move one additional hex, without spending a movement point, in the same direction as the movement that caused them to enter the hex. This extra movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, but it will not occur if it would cause the figure to move through a wall line or to enter a hex occupied by another figure, obstacle, or objective. If the movement causes the figure to enter another icy terrain hex, the effect triggers again.\n\n# PRESSURE PLATES\n\nA pressure plate\u2019s trigger and all of its effects are defined by the special rules for the scenario.

They will then perform their long rest on initiative 99 as their entire turn for the round and will not play any cards.\n\nExample: The Banner Spear goes first with initiative 15, followed by the Drifter with initiative 23, the Algox Guard with initiative 55, and the Boneshaper with initiative 81.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2279, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4ad5f4f-f62b-444a-b479-b5623c76e552": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4ad5f4f-f62b-444a-b479-b5623c76e552", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f01c11d5-f98c-4b42-86e6-efa2e7adc32f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "36cfa5aa14afbec0604e32626bb8ba82c809b7621783a107e5991cfb67656aa6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# 3.

A figure\u2019s turn starts when the previous figure ends their turn and concludes when the next figure begins theirs. During a figure\u2019s turn, they will perform various actions and abilities based on their revealed ability cards.\n\nBefore we tackle the specifics of character and monster turns, we need to cover a variety of important concepts related to actions and abilities.\n\n# Line-of-Sight\n\nWhen any figure or hex is targeted by any ability, the acting figure must have a clear line-of-sight to the target in order to perform the ability. Line-of-sight is established if a line can be drawn from any part of the acting figure\u2019s hex to any part of the target hex without touching a wall line. Only walls and closed doors block line-of-sight.\n\nIn general, negative abilities can only target enemies, and positive abilities can only target allies or the acting figure. Some abilities have specific targeting information that contradicts this rule. An ability specifying its targets as \u201call\u201d follows these restrictions, but an ability specifying its targets as \u201call figures\u201d breaks these restrictions.\n\nIf any ability specifies its target as \u201cself,\u201d the effect can only be applied to the acting figure.\n\n# Actions and Abilities Overview\n\nAn action is a set of one or more abilities, which are detailed on one half of an ability card. Characters will normally perform two actions on their turn: the top action of one of their played ability cards and the bottom action of the other character ability card is considered a single action. An entire half of a monster ability card is considered a single action.\n\n# Example Actions\n\n|Action|Details|\n|---|---|\n|Rallying Cry|Whenever an enemy moves or teleports from a hex not adjacent to you to a hex adjacent to you this round, that enemy suffers 2.|\n|Summon Banner of Strength|All allies within 2 add +1 to their attacks.|\n\n# Targeting and Range\n\nMost abilities target a figure, and a range value added to an ability determines how far away that figure can be targeted. \u201cRange X\u201d means the acting figure can target any figure within X hexes. Abilities accompanied by \u201cTarget X\u201d allow the acting figure to target up to X different figures within the ability\u2019s range.\n\nIt is not possible to target the same figure multiple times with the same ability, unless otherwise stated. Non-attack abilities with no specified range value can target figures at any range.\n\n# Ability Types\n\nAn ability is any grouping of text and/or icons, often found on an ability card, that a figure can perform to interact with the map, themselves, or other figures. If an action consists of multiple abilities, these will be separated from each other by ability lines. Abilities in an action are always performed in the order they are written.\n\nFigures cannot perform new abilities while resolving a different ability, with the exception of abilities from attack modifier cards.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3042, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37de1627-8679-4a43-b1fc-916b2ca95d3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "37de1627-8679-4a43-b1fc-916b2ca95d3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18542a32-a8f0-4f00-9278-53996531e66d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "e817a64b1f6775951ab0e309797334faf0e6da72cb5ed77995406718083f6ccf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Area of Effect\n\n# Added Effects\n\n# Elements\n\nAbilities with an area of effect allow the acting figure to target several different figures in multiple hexes at the same time. The area of effect is permitted.\n\nAdded effects are attached to an ability and modify it in some way. Common added effects like \u201cH X,\u201d \u201cL X,\u201d or conditions are usually listed in a highlighted section to the right of the ability.\n\nSome actions have an elemental affinity associated with them (fire, ice, air, earth, light, or dark).\n\n# ELEMENTAL INFUSION AND CONSUMPTION\n\nIf an elemental infusion is depicted on an action, when the acting figure performs any part of that action, they must infuse that element at the end of their turn. To infuse an element, move its token to the strong column on the element board. A figure cannot infuse an element this way unless they perform at least one of that action\u2019s abilities.\n\n|Element|Infusion|Consumption|\n|---|---|---|\n|Fire|Strong|Waning|\n|Ice|Strong|Waning|\n|Air|Strong|Waning|\n|Earth|Strong|Waning|\n|Light|Strong|Waning|\n|Dark|Strong|Waning|\n\nAt the end of every round, all infused elements wane, moving one column to the left on the element board, from strong to waning or from waning to inert.\n\nInfused elements can be consumed to add effects to certain abilities or, in some cases, perform new abilities. If an action depicts elemental consumptions in the upper left corner, all of those elements must be consumed to activate it. The same element cannot be consumed multiple times in a single turn.\n\n# Resolved Courage\n\nExample: The Banner Spear performs the top action of Resolved Courage. An ally, the Blinkblade Guard 1 and the objective 2 are both within the ability\u2019s area of effect.\n\nSome abilities or effects can only occur if something else happens first. These conditional effects are structured as \u201cApply effect A to apply effect B.\u201d Effect A must be applied for effect B to be applied.\n\nWhen a wild or mixed element is infused, the acting figure chooses which of those elements to infuse.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2027, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95c7d634-48f9-4648-abc1-b8e954dfc6f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "95c7d634-48f9-4648-abc1-b8e954dfc6f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53fd0f65-5ee3-45c0-921a-9092b287df7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "e35ab7dc570348cd4e253ea306c3a7f598cdec171afb4fec6145b0743a296e22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Attack Abilities\n\n\u201cAttack X\u201d is a negative targeted ability that allows a figure to deal a base amount of X damage to an enemy within the specified range. An attack with no specified range value is considered a melee attack with range 1, capable of targeting adjacent enemies only, unless otherwise stated. For example, if the card is then applied to the attack, possibly reducing or increasing its value. Once the effects of a drawn attack modifier card have been applied, it is placed in its discard pile.\n\n# ATTACK MODIFIER CARDS\n\nAny time an attack ability is performed, a separate attack modifier card is drawn for each individual target of the attack ability. The modifier shown on the card is then applied to the attack.\n\n# Move\n\n\u201cMove X\u201d is an ability that gives a figure X movement points. A figure must always end their movement in an unoccupied hex. A figure must enter at least one hex to be considered to have performed a move ability. All unspent movement points are lost at the end of the move ability. Figures can move through allies but cannot move through enemies, obstacles, objectives, or walls. Traps and other effects of hexes trigger when a figure enters them.\n\n# Teleport\n\n\u201cTeleport X\u201d is an ability that transports a figure to any location within X hexes of their current hex, without evaluating their path through all of the hexes between. A teleport ability is not considered a move ability and teleporting is not considered movement. Teleportation is not affected by anything, even walls, in the hexes between. A figure can only teleport to a valid hex, and any effects of entering that hex still trigger normally, unless otherwise stated. A figure cannot teleport into an unrevealed room, but they can teleport to a hex with a closed door, opening the door as a result.\n\n# Attack Modification Order\n\nWhen an attack is performed, the base attack value written on the card can be modified in four different ways in the following order:\n\n1. All applicable attack bonuses and penalties, such as \u201c\u00b1 A\u201d effects, are applied. If there are multiple bonuses or penalties, the party chooses the order in which they are applied.\n2. An attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker\u2019s deck and applied.\n3. The target\u2019s shield bonus is applied (see p. 31).\n4. Ward and brittle are applied (see p. 28). If the target has both conditions, they negate each other and are removed.\n\n# Jump\n\n\u201cJump\u201d is an added effect of a move ability. Jumping allows a figure to ignore all enemies, terrain, except for in the last hex. Difficult terrain and icy terrain are ignored completely when jumping. A figure cannot jump through walls.\n\n# Flying\n\n\u201cFlying\u201d is an active bonus (see p. 30). Flying allows a figure to completely ignore all enemies, obstacles, objectives, traps, and overlay terrain, including in the last hex. However, a flying figure still cannot end their movement in a hex occupied by another figure (and vice versa). If a flying figure occupies a hex with an immobilize trap or stun trap (see p. 29), treat them as an obstacle when determining the movement of other figures.\n\n# Standard Attack Modifier Deck\n\n|Modifier|Count|\n|---|---|\n|+0|x6|\n|-1|x5|\n|+1|x5|\n|-2|x1|\n|+2|x1|\n\n# Example\n\nThe Deathwalker A performs the bottom action of Forceful Spirits, which allows them to teleport.

Some effects cause an attack to gain advantage or disadvantage. With advantage, the attacker draws two modifiers and uses one of them. A monster always uses the better one, but a character may use either one. With disadvantage, the attacker draws two modifiers and always uses the worse one.\n\n# A. Modifier Value\n\nThis value modifies the attack value. The modifier reduces the final attack value to zero. The X modifier doubles the current attack value.\n\n# B. Added Effects\n\nSome modifiers have elemental infusions (see p 23), conditions (see p 28), or other added effects. When activated, these added effects function exactly as if written on the attack ability. The attacker must choose whether to apply any attack effects before they draw an attack modifier card.\n\n# C. Rolling Icon\n\nWhen a rolling modifier is drawn, the attacker draws additional modifiers, one at a time, until a non-rolling modifier is drawn. The drawn modifiers can then be applied in any order. The first non-rolling modifier and the one after it are compared.\n\n# D. Bless / Curse Border\n\nBless and curse cards are returned to the supply once resolved, instead of placed in the discard pile. Every curse card has a * or M icon to indicate whether it is used in character and ally decks or the monster deck.\n\n# E. Shuffle Icon\n\nAt the end of the round in which a modifier with the shuffle icon O is drawn, the discard pile is shuffled back into the deck. This shuffle is performed immediately if the deck is empty when a modifier must be drawn.\n\n# F. Sorting Icon\n\nAll standard modifiers have a 1, 2, 3, 4, A, or M icon for easy sorting. All modifiers added to a character deck through perks (see p 63) have their class icon. All modifiers added to a deck by another effect have the * icon.\n\n# Ambiguity\n\nWhen there is ambiguity about which modifier is worse, the attacker must use the one drawn first. An attack cannot gain multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage.

This reduces the attack value of an incoming attack by X. The shield bonus is only applied after all attack bonuses or penalties and modifiers have been applied.|\n|Retaliate X|\u201cRetaliate X\u201d is a positive ability that gives the acting figure a retaliate bonus of X.

Each individual hex entered must place the target closer by range.\n\n# Recover\n\nRecover is a positive targeted ability that allows a character to loot any loot tokens and treasure tiles within range X, including any in their current hex. The targeted character looks through their discard pile or lost pile, selects cards up to the number specified by the ability, and returns those cards to their hand.\n\n# Manipulating Tiles\n\nManipulating tiles is any ability that allows a figure to alter the layout of overlay tiles on the map. There are six ways to manipulate tiles:\n\n- Create: Allows a figure to place an overlay tile.\n- Destroy: Allows a figure to remove an overlay tile.\n- Relocate: Allows a figure to remove an overlay tile and place it elsewhere.\n- Move: Allows a figure to move an overlay tile up to the specified number of hexes, much like a figure would move.\n- Replace: Allows a figure to destroy an overlay tile in order to create a different overlay tile in the same hex.\n- Control: Allows a figure to control an ability of an enemy.\n\n# Commanding Figures\n\nCommanding figures is a targeted ability that allows a figure to command another figure to perform certain abilities. There are two ways to command figures:\n\n- Spring: Allows a figure to destroy a trap and apply the effects of the trap to themselves, unless otherwise stated.\n- Grant: Allows a figure to grant an ability to any figure. The commanded figure then performs that ability.\n\n# Loot\n\nWhen a loot token is looted, it is removed from the map. If the looting figure is a monster, nothing else happens. If the looting figure is a character, they draw one card from the loot deck (unless the loot deck is empty).\n\n# Suffer Damage\n\nSome abilities cause figures to suffer damage without an attack being performed. This damage is not modified by anything except ward and brittle. Suffer damage is not a targeted ability.\n\n# Example\n\nThe Banner Spear A performs the bottom action of Pincer Movement, which allows them to move and loot the two adjacent hexes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2635, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b102cc-879e-48e1-9a4f-a7794d16c2a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b102cc-879e-48e1-9a4f-a7794d16c2a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98d24589-0577-4936-b95f-aaf99a892aa6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "771df5b039177a9ecb4a4ff1852f1d87534c0fd56b2c1f740ec5dde628f63a50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Banner Spear\n\nYou specialize in ACIUE attacks which require an\n\nOn a character\u2019s turn, unless performing a long rest, they will perform the top action of one of their played ability cards and the bottom action of the other.

The rest can only be performed if the character has at least two cards in their discard pile. Resting always results in losing one card from their discard pile.\n\nDuring the End of Round step (see p 46), a character may perform a short rest. When a character short rests, they lose one random card from their discard pile and return the remaining cards to their hand. If they would like to keep the card that was lost, they can suffer 1 damage to lose a different random card instead, but this can only be done once per short rest.\n\nDuring the Card Selection step (see p 18), a character may declare a long rest. This constitutes their entire turn for the round, instead of playing two cards, and it is performed on initiative 99. When a character long rests, they follow these steps:\n\n1. Lose one card of their choice from their discard pile and return the remaining cards to their hand (mandatory).\n2. Perform \u201cHeal 2, self\u201d (optional).\n3. Recover all of their spent items (optional).\n\nItems can be used during the same turn in which they are recovered. Even if the damage is negated, effects or conditions from the source of damage are still applied.\n\n# Character Damage\n\nWhen a character would suffer any amount of damage (after ward or brittle is applied), they must either reduce their red hit point dial by that amount or negate the damage. Damage can be negated in two ways:\n\n- A. Ability or Effect: The character may use an active ability or effect which negates damage.\n- B. Card Loss: The character may lose one card of their choice from their hand, or two cards of their choice from their discard pile, to negate the damage.\n\nIf they have not yet taken their turn, the cards they selected during the Card Selection step are not in their hand or discard pile and therefore cannot be lost to negate the damage.\n\n# Monster Turns\n\nOn a monster\u2019s turn, it performs actions based on the ability card drawn for its monster set. These actions are determined by a combination of its stat card and the drawn ability card. Monster abilities are automated, so very few decisions about monster behavior need to be decided by the party.\n\n# Monster Components\n\n|Monster Type|Normal Base|Elite Base|\n|---|---|---|\n|Archer|1|2|\n|Algox Archer|5|4|\n|Ruined Machine|0|1|\n\n# Monster Stat Cards\n\nEach monster type has a double-sided monster stat card, which determines its base stats at every turn. To set the level for a monster type, its stat card is inserted in a stat sleeve so that only the relevant stats are shown. Each stat sleeve has a six-section side and a 10-section side. The side to use for a monster type depends on whether that type has four to six standees or 10 standees.\n\n# Exhaustion\n\nA character can become exhausted in two ways:\n\n- A. No Hit Points: If the character ever reaches zero on their red hit point dial.\n- B. No Cards: If the character does not have at least two cards in their hand (to play) or at least two cards in their discard pile (to rest) at the start of a round.\n\nBecoming exhausted this way does not affect their current hit point value before it dies.\n\n# Lost Actions\n\nLost actions can only be performed once. If an action has the lost icon, when any part of the action is performed, the card must be placed in the character\u2019s lost pile, where it will remain until the end of the scenario (unless recovered).

After the characters have selected and revealed their ability cards for the round, an ability card is drawn for each monster set with at least one figure currently on the map. This ability card determines when and how the monsters in that set will act during the round.\n\n# A monster ability card can have the following:\n\n|A|Card Name: A thematic name for the card.|\n|---|---|\n|B|Initiative Value: This value determines when the monsters in this set act during the round.|\n|C|List of Abilities: This list indicates which abilities the monsters in this set perform on their turns, if possible, and in what order.|\n|D|Shuffle Icon: At the end of the round in which a card with the shuffle icon is drawn, the discard pile is shuffled back into the deck.|\n|E|Set Name: The name of the monster set is listed on the card back.|\n\nThe monsters in a set only perform the abilities listed on the ability card drawn for the current round. For example, if their ability card does not list a move ability, they will not move. If their ability card does not list an attack ability, they will not attack.\n\n# Additional Foci\n\nThis focus is the enemy it can perform its attack on using the fewest movement points. Determining the shortest possible path takes into consideration the effects of difficult terrain and icy terrain. For a melee attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the melee attack. For a ranged attack, the monster identifies the shortest possible path to a hex from which it can perform the ranged attack within the specified range.\n\n# Path Priority\n\nMonsters always prioritize a path that triggers the fewest negative hexes, like traps and hazardous terrain, even when that means not maximizing targets. Monsters only trigger negative hexes when there is no other viable path to attack an enemy. For example, if a monster could attack by moving two hexes and springing a trap on the way, or by moving 10 hexes and avoiding the trap, it would take the longer path.\n\n# Focus\n\nIt does not matter whether the monster can actually reach the end of the path on its current turn. As long as there is a path to reach a hex from which to attack an enemy, the monster can focus on that enemy. Focus does not require line-of-sight.\n\n# No Focus\n\nIt is possible that a monster is unable to find a focus if it cannot reach a valid hex, given infinite movement, from which it can perform its attack. In such cases, the monster does not move or attack but still performs any other abilities listed on its ability card.\n\n# Monster Acting Order\n\nA monster set acts based on the initiative value on the ability card drawn for the current round. During their position in the initiative order, all monsters of the type act, starting with the elite monsters in ascending standee number order, then the normal monsters in ascending standee number order. Each monster completes its turn before the next monster acts.\n\n# Example\n\nEven though the Algox Guard 1 is closer by range to the Banner Spear attack on the Blinkblade, it can perform its melee attack on the Blinkblade.\n\n# Appendix B\n\nAppendix B provides a concise, illustrated guide for how monsters take their turns (see p. 74).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "697ac6de-3b9d-4648-b583-a39a30289ad9": {"__data__": {"id_": "697ac6de-3b9d-4648-b583-a39a30289ad9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17f7d41d-55cb-4d89-a723-4716dbae4ee2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "307bfae746ce33564addb587293b8612ab073800c505331678ac4d9933a7c8f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Monster Movement\n\nOnce a monster has found a focus and identified its path to that focus, it then performs the abilities listed on its ability card in order \u2014 the first of which is usually to move.\n\nA monster only moves on its turn if \u201cM \u00b1 X\u201d is listed on its ability card. This move ability gives the monster an amount of movement points equal to its base move stat (found on its stat card) modified by X (either positive or negative).\n\nA monster always uses the fewest movement points required to maximize its attacks for its current turn. If a monster cannot attack its focus on its current turn, it only moves if it can shorten the path to its focus.\n\nWhen a monster performs a ranged attack on an adjacent target, it first moves away from that target if possible, so that the attack does not have disadvantage. When a monster performs ranged attacks on multiple targets, it moves to attack the most possible targets, with the fewest possible disadvantaged attacks, while using the fewest possible movement points.\n\n# Other Monster Abilities\n\nActive Bonuses: Active bonuses from a stat card are active at all times, even if the monster is stunned. Active bonuses from an ability card are only active once the monster has taken its turn, but they remain active until the end of the round, even if the monster is later stunned.\n\nPositive Conditions: The monster applies the condition to itself or an ally within the specified range. It always targets the monster at the closest range that does not already have the condition. If there is a tie for closest range, it targets the monster that acts earliest in the initiative order.\n\nSummon Abilities: Some monsters can summon other monsters onto the map. Monster summons behave just like other monsters, acting according to the monster ability cards of their set. A monster summon must be placed in an empty hex adjacent to its summoner and as close to an enemy as possible. If there is no adjacent hex available, or no standee of the corresponding monster type, the summon ability cannot be performed. Monster summons never take a turn during the round in which they are summoned. When the initiative value of a monster summon is required for the focus rules, if it does not have a monster ability card drawn for its set this round, draw one to determine an initiative value solely for the purpose of other figures\u2019 abilities.\n\nLoot Abilities: Monsters do not perform end-of-turn looting, unlike characters, but some monsters have loot abilities. In such cases, the monster loots all loot tokens within the specified range, removing them from the map. These loot tokens are not dropped by the monster when it dies. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.\n\n# Monster Attacks\n\nA monster only attacks on its turn if \u201cA \u00b1 X\u201d is listed on its ability card. This attack ability allows the monster to attack using its base attack stat (found on its stat card) modified by X (either positive or negative). The range of the attack is specified on the ability card. If no range is specified, it is a melee attack.\n\nIf a monster lists multiple targets as an attack effect on its stat card, the number of targets can be modified by \u201cT \u00b1 X\u201d effects. A monster only attacks its focus (or foci in the case of multiple targets). When its ability card lists multiple attack abilities, a monster can perform all of those attacks on a single focus.\n\nIf a monster kills or exhausts its focus and still has attacks remaining, it will use the focus rules to find a new focus.\n\n# Monsters and Elements\n\nMonsters can infuse and consume elements. When a monster ability card depicts an infusion or consumption, it triggers if at least one monster of the set performs an ability. An infusion occurs when the last monster of the set ends their turn, while a consumption occurs when the first monster of the set starts their turn and benefits every monster of the set.\n\n# Example\n\nThe elite Algox Archer 1 has 2 movement points, but only needs 1 to perform its A or the Boneshaper R3 attack on either the Geminate B.

If a specified location is not empty, place the monster in the closest empty hex instead.\n\nUnlike monsters that have been summoned, monsters that have been revealed or spawned act during the same round in which they were added to the map.\n\nIf a newly added monster set does not have an ability card drawn for the current round, draw one now.\n\nCheck the initiative value for the sets of all added monsters. If their initiative value comes after the acting figure\u2019s initiative value, their initiative order token should be in its normal position; they will act in normal initiative order. If their initiative value comes before the acting figure\u2019s initiative value, move or insert their initiative order token after the acting figure\u2019s token; they will act next. When multiple new monster sets would act next, order their tokens based on initiative values.\n\nWhen monsters are added to the map, if there are not enough standees of the right type, place as many monsters as possible, starting with elite monsters, in order of proximity to an enemy. Once the standees run out, do not place the remaining monsters. If there are not enough bases of the right color, place the remaining monsters without bases.\n\n# Named Monsters\n\nNamed monsters are a special class of monster. For some scenarios, the goal is to kill a unique variant of a monster type, which is given a name in the scenario rules. Place named monster standees in red bases to identify them. Named monsters are not considered normal or elite, so they are not affected by abilities that target those ranks.\n\n# Monster Damage and Death\n\nWhen a monster suffers damage, place damage tokens on its stat sleeve in the section corresponding to its standee number. As soon as the total amount of damage suffered by a monster is equal to its maximum hit point value, it dies. When a monster dies, remove its standee from the map, clear all tokens from its section of the stat sleeve, and place a loot token in the hex where it died, even if it was summoned or spawned, unless it was a character ally. No attack effects can be applied to a monster after it dies.\n\n# KILL CREDIT\n\nCertain battle goals, personal quests, and abilities require characters to track their kills credit for their summoner. If a monster dies from damage caused by an attack, retaliate bonus, or suffer damage ability, the figure who caused the damage gets credit for the kill. If a monster dies from damage caused by a negative hex due to forced movement, the figure who caused the forced movement gets credit for the kill.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3179, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e6090b7-e30e-4789-a290-1b8c20936994": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e6090b7-e30e-4789-a290-1b8c20936994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6bb78a6e-e263-4f92-bdb2-2f382da48dbc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "932be86d6eb994a2050f245827ca8177220cd81c8377ad703e578b154c342946", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# 4. End of Round\n\n# Ending & Scenario\n\nAfter all figures on the map have taken a turn (except figures that were summoned during the round), the End of Round step begins. Perform the following operations in order:\n\n1. Trigger any end-of-round effects in the scenario rules or on items or character ability cards.\n2. If any drawn attack modifier card or monster ability card has a shuffle icon, shuffle the corresponding discard pile back into the deck.\n3. Any character ability card in a character\u2019s active area has a round bonus, place it in their discard pile or lost pile, depending on whether the action has a lost icon.\n4. Any character who has at least two cards in their discard pile may perform a short rest (see p. 38).\n5. Move any infused elements one column to the left on the element board, from strong to waning or from waning to inert.\n\nOnce the end of the scenario is triggered, play continues until the current round is over, and then the scenario ends. If the scenario would be both lost and completed in the same round, the scenario is lost.\n\nThe scenario is completed if the specific goal listed in the scenario rules is achieved. Each character notes how much experience they gained during the scenario. The base experience is shown on their blue dial. If the scenario was completed, each character gains bonus experience based on the scenario level (see p. 16). The total is then added to the current experience total on their character sheet.\n\nEach character recovers all of their discarded and lost ability cards, recovers all of their spent and lost items, and resets their red dial to their maximum hit point value. All conditions are removed from the characters.\n\nEach character notes how much gold they gained during the scenario. The base gold is shown on their loot cards. Whether the scenario was lost or completed, this amount is multiplied by the current conversion rate, which is based on the scenario level (see p. 16). The total is then added to the current gold total on their character sheet.\n\n# Common Scenario Rules\n\nAllies: Certain figures are allies of the party. Each ally is represented either by a monster standee, in which case their stats are defined by their monster stat card, or by a numbered scenario aid token, in which case their stats are defined by the scenario rules.\n\nLinked Hexes: Certain hexes on the map are linked to each other. Linked hexes are considered adjacent for the purpose of movement. There is no line-of-sight between linked hexes, but figures can find focus through linked hexes.\n\nLocked Doors: Certain doors are locked at the start of the scenario. Locked doors cannot be opened normally. They act as walls until the specified conditions which unlock them have been met. Once unlocked, they can be opened normally.\n\nRound Track: If a scenario has effects that occur at specific times, the rounds can be tracked via the round track at the top of the element board. Advance the round marker one space at the end of each round.\n\nScenario Aid Tokens: These numbered or lettered tokens represent allies or loot or even act as reminders for special rules, such as where enemies spawn or when to read a section. These tokens do not affect the empty status of a hex.\n\nEquations: Certain variables, such as hit point values for objectives or named monsters, are determined by equations. These equations can depend on scenario level (L), number of characters (C), or maximum hit point value of an elite monster of the relevant type (H). For example, if a named Polar Bear has (C \u00d7 H) hit points, then its maximum hit point value is equal to the number of characters multiplied by the maximum hit point value of an elite Polar Bear.\n\n# Lost Scenario\n\nIf the scenario was lost, the party chooses between the following options:\n\n1. Return to Frosthaven: Characters gain the resources from their loot cards, and all experience, gold, and treasure gained during the scenario is kept. The Outpost Phase occurs (see p. 59). The party can then attempt any available scenario, including the scenario they just lost, and they resolve a road event if necessary.\n2. Replay the Scenario: Characters do not gain the resources from their loot cards, but all experience, gold, and treasure gained during the scenario is kept. The Outpost Phase does not occur.

Looted Resources: Each character gains any resources from their loot cards. Resources are tallied on their character sheet.\n2. Battle Goals: Each character gains any checkmarks from achieving their battle goal. Checkmarks are tracked on their character sheet. For every set of three checkmarks, the character gains a perk mark (see p. 63).\n3. Masteries: Each character gains one perk mark for any new mastery they achieved during the scenario. Even if they became exhausted during the scenario, they can still achieve a mastery if its requirements were met at the time they became exhausted. Each mastery can only be achieved once per character.\n4. Inspiration: Gain inspiration equal to 4 minus the number of characters (see p. 54). Inspiration is tallied on the campaign sheet.\n5. Scenario Conclusion: Read the conclusion of the scenario, which is found in the section indicated by the specific goal for the scenario. Even if a character is exhausted, as long as the scenario was completed, they may still achieve their battle goal, gain scenario rewards, and keep all of the experience, gold, and loot they gained during the scenario.\n6. Updated Map: Mark the scenario as completed on the map board. Completed scenarios can still be replayed during the same campaign. However, the scenario rewards and any numbered treasures can only be gained once.\n\n# The Adventure Begins\n\nThe second part of this rulebook covers how to interact with the outpost of Frosthaven and how to manage the overall campaign, none of which is necessary for your first scenario. When you are ready to start playing and officially begin your campaign, read the text at the front of the scenario book. This text will tell you that two new scenarios have been unlocked (scenarios 0 and 1).\n\n# SCENARIO 0 AND 1\n\nIf you are new to the Gloomhaven system, play scenario 0 now. This is a short, low-stakes scenario with minimal rewards, and it is meant to familiarize you with your characters and give you a chance to practice the rules you\u2019ve just learned. If you are already familiar with the Gloomhaven system, you can skip scenario 0 and go directly to scenario 1, the first official scenario of the campaign.\n\nAfter completing a scenario, the party normally returns to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase (see p. 59). If another scenario is linked to the completed scenario, they may skip the Outpost Phase and play it. If another scenario is force-linked to the completed scenario, they must skip the Outpost Phase and play it. If this was not the first time the scenario was completed during the same campaign, all scenario links are ignored and the party must return to Frosthaven for an Outpost Phase.\n\n# Example:\n\n1. When scenario 4 is unlocked, open the corresponding window of the scenario flowchart, which reveals the scenario details.\n2.

The collective group of characters you play is referred to as \u201cthe party.\u201d New characters will join the party and old characters will leave the party, but it is always the same party throughout the campaign.\n\nOver the course of the campaign, you will adventure through a multitude of scenarios, encounter a variety of events, level up, purchase and craft gear, retire your characters, create new ones, and improve the outpost of Frosthaven. There is an eventual ending to the campaign narrative, but you are welcome to continue past that point, replaying scenarios and exploring further to unlock content you have not yet discovered.\n\n# Campaign Information\n\nCampaign information is tracked mainly by the following:\n\n- Map Board: This provides a visual representation of which scenarios have been unlocked and which buildings have been built in Frosthaven.\n- Scenario Flowchart: This provides a more detailed overview of unlocked scenarios. The scenario flowchart shows how the scenarios are connected to each other. When a scenario is unlocked, open and tear off the corresponding window of the flowchart. On the back of the window will be a sticker, which should be affixed to the map board at the specified coordinates (or, in the case of \u201cFR,\u201d at the numbered position in the lower half of the map).\n- Building Deck: This provides detailed information on the buildings in Frosthaven.\n- Character Sheets: These track each character\u2019s progression and supply.\n- Campaign Sheet: This tracks all of the other campaign variables.\n\n# Scenario Flowchart\n\nThe revealed section of the flowchart will have information about the scenario, including its name, number, coordinates, geographic location, and any requirements. See the icon key on the back of the flowchart for more details.\n\nThe colored bar beneath the name of each scenario indicates which scenario chain it is part of, and looking between the various windows on the flowchart are arrows that show how the scenarios are connected to each other. These make it easier to track your path through the campaign.\n\n# Map Board\n\nThe map board tracks which scenarios are available, as well as which buildings and other features currently exist in and around Frosthaven.\n\n# Scenario Stickers\n\nWhen a scenario is unlocked, retrieve its sticker from the corresponding window of the scenario flowchart and affix it to the map board at the specified coordinates, matching up the artwork. When a scenario is completed, mark the checkbox on its sticker.\n\n# Building Stickers\n\nWhen a building is unlocked, take its initial \u201cL0\u201d sticker from the newly opened envelope and affix it to the map board at the numbered position, matching up the artwork. The sticker depicts the prosperity level and resources required to build the first level of the building. When a building is built or upgraded, cover its current sticker on the map board with a new sticker for the next level of the building.\n\n# Other Stickers\n\nOccasionally, you will be directed to affix other types of stickers to the map board. These other stickers and their functions will be explained as they are introduced.\n\n# Example\n\nThe level 0 building space for the Hunting Lodge is printed on the map board.

The starting building deck consists of the Barracks (level 1), Craftsman (level 1), Alchemist (level 1), and Workshop (level 1). At the start of the campaign, apply any one-time effects indicated on these cards.\n\nThe cards in the building deck should always be arranged in sequential order based on their reference numbers. If a building has multiple levels, only the card corresponding to its current level should be in the deck. Each card has a normal side and a wrecked side. When the status of a building changes, its card is flipped accordingly. All building cards not in the building deck should remain separate or stored in their original envelopes.\n\n# A character sheet has the following:\n\n|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Class:|Name:|Level:|Experience:|Gold:|Resources:|Notes:|Masteries:|Checkmarks:|Perks:|\n|The icon and name of the character\u2019s class|A space to write the name given to the character|A track to mark the character\u2019s current level, which also shows the experience requirement to reach each level|A space to record the character\u2019s current experience total|A space to record the character\u2019s current gold total.

The pad contains multiple sheets, in case they are needed for any reason, but only one campaign can be in progress at any given time.\n\n# A. Campaign Calendar\n\nThis tracks the passage of time, measured in weeks. When the party returns to Frosthaven after a scenario, mark the next box. You might also be instructed to mark the next box at other times in the campaign. Marking these boxes can have various effects (see p 59). There are 10 weeks per season and two seasons, summer and winter, per year. If the campaign lasts longer than four years, use a new campaign sheet to continue tracking the passage of time.\n\n# B. Frosthaven Supply\n\nThis tracks the party\u2019s resources. Any material resources here can be used to pay various costs for buildings, while any herb resources here can be used to craft items and brew potions. All resources here can be used to pay collective costs from scenarios or events. At any time, characters can move resources from their personal supplies to the Frosthaven supply, but they cannot move resources from the Frosthaven supply to their personal supplies.\n\n# C. Inspiration Value\n\nThis marks the party\u2019s current inspiration. When the party receives \u201c\u00b1X inspiration,\u201d adjust this value accordingly. When the party completes a scenario, they gain inspiration equal to 4 minus the number of characters. The party can spend any amount of inspiration in place of an equal number of material resources when paying various costs for buildings. Characters can spend 15 inspiration when retiring to complete an additional personal quest (see p 64).\n\n# D. Total Defense Value\n\nThis marks Frosthaven\u2019s current defense. This value is mainly referenced when resolving attack events (see p 60). When the party receives \u201c\u00b1X defense,\u201d adjust this value accordingly. Modifiers from the morale track are not cumulative; only the current modifier is applicable.\n\n# E. Soldiers\n\nThese can be spent during an attack defense check (see p 61). When the party gains or loses X soldiers, mark or erase X circles accordingly. The maximum number of soldiers the party can have is limited by the current level of the Barracks.\n\n# F. Morale Track\n\nThis marks Frosthaven\u2019s current morale. Certain event outcomes have a morale requirement, and Frosthaven\u2019s total defense is affected by the modifier indicated next to the current morale (see p 61). When the party receives \u201c\u00b1X morale,\u201d adjust this track accordingly. The party can lose 1 morale to perform a repair, instead of spending resources (see p 61), and they can lose 2 morale to perform an extra build or upgrade (see p 68). The morale track has a minimum value (0) and a maximum value (20). If the minimum or maximum is ever reached, read the indicated section from the section book. The party\u2019s starting morale is determined at the end of scenario 1.\n\n# G. Campaign Stickers\n\nThis tracks the party\u2019s campaign stickers. When the party gains a campaign sticker, affix it here. If one campaign sticker is gained and another lost at the same time, cover the old sticker with the new one. Having a specific campaign sticker can change the outcome of an event or scenario.\n\n# H. Prosperity Track\n\nThis marks Frosthaven\u2019s current prosperity. The prosperity level determines the maximum starting level for new characters (see p 65) and the maximum level for building upgrades (see p 68). When the party receives \u201c+X prosperity,\u201d mark the next X boxes. Each time a numbered box is marked, the prosperity level increases. When the party receives \u201c-X prosperity,\u201d erase the previous X boxes, but never erase a numbered box or further.\n\n# I. Retirement Table\n\nThis serves as an ongoing record of retired characters. When a character retires (see p 64), record their information in this table.

They may build or upgrade one building by default, and they may lose 2 morale to build or upgrade a second building. Buildings cannot be upgraded while wrecked. The party may also rebuild any number of wrecked buildings, but not until after any builds and upgrades.\n\n# Casual Mode\n\nTo build an unlocked building, the party must pay its build cost, which is shown on the building\u2019s \u201cL0\u201d sticker (or printed directly on the map board itself in some cases) with resources from the Frosthaven supply. When this cost is paid, cover it with the matching level 1 sticker and insert the matching level 1 card into the building deck in sequential order. The party then gains the prosperity bonus and applies any other one-time effects indicated on the building card.\n\nDuring the next Outpost Phase, the building\u2019s normal effect will resolve and its interactions will be available (unless it gets wrecked). However, completed scenarios can be replayed as part of the campaign (i.e., not in casual mode) as long as the party still meets their requirements.\n\n# Solo Mode\n\nA single player can play solo by controlling two or more characters. Because playing solo reduces uncertainty and makes coordination easier, increase the difficulty by calculating the scenario level differently for solo mode. Take the average level of all characters in the scenario, then add 1 before dividing by 2 and rounding up. For example, on recommended difficulty with three level 4 characters, the scenario level would be ((4 + 4 + 4) \u00f7 3 \u00f7 2) = 2, but in solo mode it would be ((((4 + 4 + 4) \u00f7 3) + 1) \u00f7 2) = 3.\n\n# Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade an existing building, the party must pay its upgrade cost, which is shown on the normal side of the current building card, with resources from the Frosthaven supply. When this cost is paid, cover the old sticker with the one for the next level and replace the old card in the building deck with the one for the next level. The party then gains the prosperity bonus and applies any other one-time effects indicated on the new building card.\n\n# Rebuild\n\nTo rebuild a wrecked building, the party must pay the rebuild cost, which is shown on the wrecked side of the building card, with resources from the Frosthaven supply. When this cost is paid, flip the building card back over to its normal side within the building deck. During the next Outpost Phase, the building\u2019s normal effect will resolve and its interactions will be available again (unless it gets wrecked).\n\n# Temporary Enhancements\n\nWith this variant, enhancement stickers are removed when a character retires. This can be facilitated by affixing the stickers to card sleeves, instead of directly to the ability cards, or by applying reusable stickers (which are sold separately). Temporary enhancements have a reduced cost: First, calculate the normal enhancement cost, including any discounts. Next, if the card has at least one previous enhancement, reduce the cost by 20 gold. Finally, reduce the cost by 20 percent (rounded up).\n\n# Reduced Randomness\n\nWith this variant, parties who want less randomness can reduce the range of outcomes caused by attack modifier cards. Treat all / and c cards as instead, and treat all X and b cards as instead. Even though these cards no longer have the same modifiers, the effect of the shuffle icon still applies. Any item effects or other game effects that refer to / or X cards are unaffected.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3528, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bb0dcbc-de4f-4efc-a366-b0fa79b1fd2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bb0dcbc-de4f-4efc-a366-b0fa79b1fd2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "044f9d70-2030-4983-bd57-569d80a311ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "8d488504bba0456a4e22af3e96629998e9857884f0a66ecf3769e3d961aec038", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Random Dungeons, cont.\n\n# Permanent Death\n\nWith this variant, the specter of death looms large for parties who want higher stakes. When a character drops to zero hit points, they die instead of becoming exhausted. Characters can still become exhausted if unable to play two cards or perform a long rest, but they survive and can still participate in future scenarios, even if the current scenario is lost.\n\nWhen a character dies, they are removed from the campaign at the end of the current scenario. Their personal quest is shuffled back into the deck, their character materials are put back in the corresponding tuck boxes, their items are returned to the available supply, their resources are moved to the Frosthaven supply, and their gold is lost. The player whose character died must create a new character during the Downtime step of the next Outpost Phase (or, if the next scenario is force-linked, immediately before the scenario begins).\n\n# Random Dungeons\n\nWith this variant, the party can attempt a random dungeon instead of an official scenario, either as part of the ongoing campaign or as a one-off session in casual mode. Each random dungeon has three randomly generated rooms, and the party must clear the monsters from all three rooms in order to complete it. These rooms are revealed one at a time, with each new room only revealed when a character opens the door.\n\n# Penalties\n\nFor recommended difficulty, apply no penalty for the first room, the minor penalty for the second room, and the major penalty for the third room. The party can scale the difficulty as they wish by adjusting the number and severity of these penalties. If the penalty of the first room refers to the character who opened the door, the party can decide who it applies to.\n\n# Generate RANDOM SETUP CARD\n\nA random setup card contains the following:\n\n- Major: When the next enemy dies, spawn one elite Living Bones at the closest sarcophagus.\n- Minor: When the next enemy dies, spawn one normal Living Bones at the closest sarcophagus.\n\n# RANDOM ROOM CARD\n\nA random room card contains the following:\n\n- A Noun Title: A noun title. When combined with the adjective title from the random setup card, this creates the full title of the room.\n- Map Tiles: The map tiles for the room. Required overlay tiles will be shown, as well as 12 map designations for the placement of various features shown on the random setup card.\n- Treasure Contents: The contents of any treasure tiles in the room. Specific loot that is important to the campaign will never appear in a random dungeon.\n- Trap Types: The types of any traps in the room.\n- Entrance and Exit Locations: The locations of the entrances and exits to the room. These always correspond to the closest border hex of the map tile with a puzzle connection.\n\n# Character Respeccing\n\nWith this variant, parties who want more flexible characters can pay to change their builds. During the Downtime step of the Outpost Phase, any character may spend gold equal to 10 times their current level in order to respec. This allows them to reset all of their previous ability card choices. When a character respecs, they return all ability cards from their pool that are not level 1 or level X, then make a new choice at each level, following the normal rules for leveling up, until they reach their current level.\n\n# Entrance and Exit Types\n\nWhen a room has two exits, the party must choose only one. If the first room has two entrances, the party must choose only one entrance that matches their chosen exit from the previous room. If the back of the next room card does not show a matching entrance, discard until a card with a matching entrance appears.\n\n|Entrance A|Entrance B|Exit A|Exit B|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|A|B|A|B|", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3751, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f81ddfdc-6f49-42ff-bef3-8d314df505a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f81ddfdc-6f49-42ff-bef3-8d314df505a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50c18924-e66c-4740-9720-014591e15dd2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "pdfs\\fh rulebook.pdf", "file_name": "fh rulebook.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 38970889, "creation_date": "2024-09-14", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-27"}, "hash": "6b0105fe24e8fe89383f4fe3c6499e20d693225a83dec110186a344f3a334080", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Appendix A: Component Inventory\n\n# 17 LARGE TUCK BOXES (6 UNSEALED, 11 SEALED)\n\n# Class Notes\n\n|Ability|Count|\n|---|---|\n|Sunless Apparition|1|\n|Summon Shadow Beast|1|\n|Shadow Token|3|\n\nThis ability can only be performed if you remove one from an adjacent hex.\n\n# Attack Target Range\n\nRules Reference: Move Jump p.21 Teleport Active Bonuses p.30 HP Damage Heal Loot XP\n\n|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|\n\n# Conditions\n\n# Valrath Deathwalker\n\n# Perks\n\n|Character Mats|Ability Cards|Special|Level|XP|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|17|30| |1|0|\n\nWhenever you long rest, you may move one to three hexes.\n\n# Masteries\n\nRemove seven cards in one round.\n\n# Welcome to Frosthaven!\n\nThere are a significant number of components in this game box, and it\u2019s important to make sure they are organized before you start playing the game.

A shield bonus only reduces damage from attacks, not from other sources, but the bonus applies to all incoming attacks while active. Even if an attack deals no damage (e.g., when a / card is drawn), all added effects of the attack are still applied. A character can negate all damage from one source by losing one card from their hand or two cards from their discard pile.\n\nA character cannot perform two top actions or two bottom actions. For the basic actions, \u201cA 2\u201d is always a top action, and \u201cM 2\u201d is always a bottom action. Exhaustion does not reduce the number of characters in the scenario, for variables like monster hit points or scenario effects.\n\n# Summons\n\nSummons must be placed in empty hexes adjacent to the summoner. If there are not enough hexes available, the summon ability cannot be performed. Summons are not directly controlled by their summoner. Most summons instead obey automated monster rules.\n\n# Bless and Curse\n\nWhen there are two opposing sides for the monsters in a scenario, they use two different attack modifier decks (M and A) and thus are affected by bless and curse separately. Immunity to curse prevents a figure from adding a curse card to their deck, but does not prevent a drawn curse card from taking effect. Bless and curse cards are returned to the supply once resolved, instead of placed in the discard pile. They are removed from all decks at the end of each scenario.\n\n# Loot and Elements\n\nAll monsters, except character allies, drop a loot token when they die. All characters loot the hex they occupy at the end of their turn, not the end of each movement. Monsters and summons do not perform end-of-turn looting.\n\n# Monsters\n\nA monster ability card is drawn each round for each set of monsters on the map. All monsters of a single set will use the same ability card. A monster only performs the abilities listed on its ability card for the round. A monster does not apply any active bonuses from its ability card until its turn. If a monster cannot find a focus, it will not move. If a monster will not be performing an attack on its turn, or has disarm, it finds a focus as if for a single-target melee attack.\n\n# Scenario Details\n\nThe recommended scenario level is half the average character level (rounded up).
